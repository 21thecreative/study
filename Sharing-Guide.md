DartPad uses github [gists](https://gist.github.com/) to publicly share your creations.

DartPad looks for three files in each gist:
* index.html
* main.dart
* styles.css

In order to share your code with others:
1. create a Gist with any of three files.
2. Direct Dartpad to the gist ID. i.e [https://dartpad.dartlang.org/72d83fe97bfc8e735607](https://dartpad.dartlang.org/72d83fe97bfc8e735607) directs to [https://gist.github.com/72d83fe97bfc8e735607](https://gist.github.com/72d83fe97bfc8e735607)
