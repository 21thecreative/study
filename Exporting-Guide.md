If you're here, you've probably hit the export button.

Exporting an embedded DartPad into the main DartPad editor enables many of the sharing features.

For clarification, exporting does NOT:

1. Create a gist
2. Share your work
3. Create a URL you can share

Exporting allows you to edit and re-share the DartPad. In order to share or create an embedded link again,
follow the following instructions in main DartPad:

1. Finalize any edits
2. Click share in the top right corner
3. Confirm the share

At this point, you will be able to get the general URL.

If you want to embed, click the embed button and source code for embedding options will be provided.
