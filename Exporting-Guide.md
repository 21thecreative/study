If you're here, you've probably hit the export button.

Exporting allows you to edit and re-share the DartPad. For clarification, exporting does **NOT**:

1. Create a gist
2. Share your work
3. Create a URL you can share

In order to share or create an embedded link again,
complete the following instructions in main DartPad:

1. Finalize any edits
2. Click share in the top right corner
3. Confirm the share


At this point, you will be able to get the iframe source code. The Dart documentation and Html views will be available for pre-selection. The minimal embedding is still available at embed-inline.html.
